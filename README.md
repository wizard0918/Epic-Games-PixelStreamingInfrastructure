# The new home for the Pixel Streaming servers!
The Pixel Streaming servers and web frontend that used to live in `Samples/PixelStreaming/WebServers` now live in this repo. 

## Goals

The goals of this repository are to:

- Adopt a more rapid release cadence for the Pixel Streaming servers (to mitigate browser breaking changes sooner).
- Encourage easier contribution by Unreal Engine licensees who are using the Pixel Streaming servers and frontend.
- Facilitate a more standard release mechanism for web components (e.g. NPM packages or similar... coming soon).
- Grant a permissive license to distribute and modify these servers and frontend wherever you see fit (MIT licensed).

## Repository contents

Reference implementations for the various pieces of infrastructure needed to support running a PixelStreaming application:
- SignallingWebServer (Cirrus)
- SFU (Single Forwarding Unit)
- Matchmaker
