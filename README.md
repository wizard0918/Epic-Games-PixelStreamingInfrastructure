# The new home for the Pixel Streaming servers!
The Pixel Streaming servers and web frontend that was in `Samples/PixelStreaming/WebServers` is now here. 

## Goals

The goals of this repository are to:

- Increase the release cadence for the Pixel Streaming servers (to mitigate browser breaking changes sooner).
- Encourage easier contribution of these components by Unreal Engine licensees.
- Facilitate a more standard web release mechanism (e.g. NPM packages or similar... coming soon).
- Grant a permissive license to distribute and modify this code wherever you see fit (MIT licensed).

## Repository contents

Reference implementations for the various pieces needed to support a PixelStreaming application:
- SignallingWebServer (Cirrus)
- SFU (Single Forwarding Unit)
- Matchmaker
